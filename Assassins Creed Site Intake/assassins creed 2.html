     <h3>What is Assassins Creed II</h3>
     <p>Assassin's Creed II is a 2009 video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released on 17 November 2009 (US), 19 November 2009 (AU) and 20 November 2009 (worldwide) on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PC version was released on 6 March 2010 (UK) and 9 March 2010 (US).
        A direct sequel to Assassin's Creed, the game focuses again on Desmond Miles after he escapes from Abstergo Industries with the help of employee Lucy Stillman. In an attempt to thwart Abstergo and the modern-day Templars, Desmond uses a new Animus to relive the genetic memories of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who lived in Italy during the Renaissance. The player controls Desmond to a degree, but primarily Ezio, who becomes an Assassin after his family is betrayed. While controlling Ezio, the player can explore renditions of major Italian regions and cities through a mixture of action, stealth, and economic gameplay.
        On 16 November 2010, a follow-up in the form of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was released, expanding on both Ezio's life and the modern day storyline.
        A remastered version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as part of The Ezio Collection in November 2018.</p>


    <h3>What is the storyline of the game?</h3>
    <p>You play as Ezio again in Italy killing the bad guys, parkouring, doing missions for the brotherhood even that hes dead you play with him because he is a far ancestor.
        of an ex-assassin the boy learned that as a assassin you cab do good things to and you only have to kill bad people and how good it felt to be the silent hero
        because assassins work in the day but stay in the shadows. In the game you can meet and talk to NPC's for example if you help them with the bad guys.
        they give you intel or they will help you get in somewhere.(can't spoil anything can I :)]</p>
